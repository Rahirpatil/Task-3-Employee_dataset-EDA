📊 Task 3: Employee Dataset Visualization – Internship Project

This notebook is the third task of my Artificial Intelligence internship at iGAP Technologies. The objective was to explore and visualize key features of an employee dataset using various statistical plots. This task focuses on identifying trends across departments, genders, locations, and understanding numerical distributions like age, experience, salary, and performance scores.

## 🧼 Key Steps & Visualizations

- **Data Loading**: Loaded the employee dataset from a CSV file and prepared it for visualization.
  
- **Department Distribution**: Counted employee frequency across departments using a bright-themed countplot.

- **Gender Breakdown**: Visualized gender distribution using a Set2-colored countplot.

- **Location Overview**: Counted employees by location with a muted palette and rotated x-axis labels for better readability.

- **Age Distribution**: Plotted a histogram of employee ages to analyze spread, using 10 bins for segmentation.

- **Experience Spread**: Visualized years of experience with a 15-bin histogram to identify employee experience levels.

- **Salary by Department**: Used a barplot to compare average monthly salaries across departments, applying a viridis color palette.

- **Performance Scores**: Created a boxplot to observe the distribution and variability of performance scores across departments using a pastel palette.
